    <h5><strong>Web Development in Python</strong></h5>
    <p>Web development in Python involves creating web applications, websites, and web services using various
        frameworks, tools, and libraries. Here's an overview of web development aspects in Python:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Web Frameworks</li>
        <p>Web frameworks provide a structured way to build web applications. Some popular Python web frameworks
            include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Django</strong>: A full-stack framework that emphasizes rapid development, security, and
                scalability.</li>
            <li><strong>Flask</strong>: A lightweight micro-framework that offers flexibility and is suitable
                for
                smaller projects.</li>
            <li><strong>FastAPI</strong>: A modern, high-performance framework for building APIs with automatic
                OpenAPI
                documentation.</li>
        </ul>

        <li><strong>Front-End Development</strong></li>
        <p>While Python is mainly used for back-end development, you can use it to generate HTML templates and
            integrate
            with front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Frameworks like Django provide
            template
            engines for generating dynamic content.</p>

        <li><strong>Database Integration</strong></li>
        <p>Python web frameworks offer integration with various databases, such as SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL,
            and
            more.
            Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) libraries like Django's ORM allow you to interact with databases
            using
            Python classes.</p>

        <li><strong>Authentication and Security</strong></li>
        <p>Web frameworks provide mechanisms for user authentication and authorization. Security measures, such
            as
            data
            validation, password hashing, and protection against common attacks, are also important
            considerations.
        </p>

        <li><strong>RESTful APIs and Web Services</strong></li>
        <p>Python is often used to build APIs and web services using frameworks like Flask or FastAPI. These
            APIs
            allow
            applications to communicate and exchange data over the web.</p>

        <li><strong>Deployment and Hosting</strong></li>
        <p>Deploying a Python web application involves configuring a web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) and
            deploying
            the
            application using technologies like WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) or ASGI (Asynchronous Server
            Gateway
            Interface). Platforms like Heroku, AWS, and DigitalOcean offer hosting solutions.</p>

        <li><strong>Real-Time Web Applications</strong></li>
        <p>For real-time applications, you can use libraries like <code>WebSocket</code> for asynchronous
            communication
            between the client and server.</p>

        <li><strong>Content Management Systems (CMS)</strong></li>
        <p>Django offers a powerful CMS called Wagtail that allows you to build and manage content-driven
            websites.
        </p>

        <li><strong>Testing and Debugging</strong></li>
        <p>Testing frameworks like <code>pytest</code> and <code>unittest</code> help ensure your web
            application
            functions as expected. Debugging techniques and tools discussed earlier are also applicable to web
            development.</p>

        <p>Python's versatility and a wide range of libraries make it suitable for various aspects of web
            development.
            Choosing the right framework and tools depends on your project's requirements, complexity, and your
            familiarity with the technology stack.</p>
    </ol>
