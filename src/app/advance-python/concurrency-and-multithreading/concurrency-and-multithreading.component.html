<h4>Concurrency and Multithreading in Python</h4>
<p>Concurrency and multithreading in Python involve executing multiple tasks concurrently to improve efficiency
    and responsiveness. However, Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) limits true parallelism in CPU-bound
    tasks. Let's explore the concepts of concurrency and multithreading in Python:</p>

<li>Concurrency vs. Parallelism</li>
<p><strong>Concurrency</strong>: Executing multiple tasks in overlapping time periods, allowing progress on
    multiple tasks without completing any single task.<br>
    <strong>Parallelism</strong>: Executing multiple tasks simultaneously on separate processors or cores.
</p>

<li>Threading</li>
<p>Threading in Python uses the <code>threading</code> module to create threads. Threads share the same memory
    space, making them suitable for I/O-bound tasks. However, due to the GIL, they might not significantly
    improve performance for CPU-bound tasks.</p>

<li>Thread Safety</li>
<p>When using threads, ensure proper synchronization to avoid issues like data corruption or race conditions.
    Python's <code>threading</code> module provides synchronization primitives like locks and semaphores.</p>

<li>Concurrency with <code>asyncio</code></li>
<p>For I/O-bound tasks, consider using the <code>asyncio</code> library, which is based on asynchronous
    programming and coroutines. It's more efficient than threads for I/O operations and handles concurrency
    effectively.</p>

<li>Multiprocessing</li>
<p>For CPU-bound tasks, the <code>multiprocessing</code> module can be used to create separate processes, which
    bypass the GIL and utilize multiple CPU cores.</p>

<p>When working with concurrency and multithreading in Python, consider the nature of your tasks. For I/O-bound
    operations, <code>asyncio</code> might be more suitable. For CPU-bound tasks, <code>multiprocessing</code>
    can provide true parallelism, bypassing the GIL.</p>
