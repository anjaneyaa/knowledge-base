<h4>Unicode and Internationalization in Python</h4>
<p>Unicode and internationalization (i18n) are essential aspects of programming in Python when dealing with text
    data from different languages and character sets. Unicode is a standard that provides a unique numeric value
    (code point) for every character across various writing systems and languages.</p>

<li>Unicode Strings</li>
<p>In Python 3, strings are represented as Unicode strings by default. This means you can include characters
    from various languages and character sets in a single string.</p>

<pre><code>
text = "Hello, 你好, привет!"
    </code></pre>

<li>Encoding and Decoding</li>
<p>Encoding is the process of converting Unicode strings into bytes (byte sequences), while decoding is the
    reverse process. Common encodings include UTF-8, UTF-16, and ASCII.</p>

<pre><code>
encoded_bytes = text.encode("utf-8")
decoded_text = encoded_bytes.decode("utf-8")
    </code></pre>

<li>Working with Files</li>
<p>When reading or writing text files, always specify the desired encoding explicitly to ensure proper handling
    of Unicode characters.</p>

<pre><code>
with open("file.txt", "w", encoding="utf-8") as file:
    file.write(text)
    </code></pre>

<li>String Formatting</li>
<p>Unicode characters can be used in string formatting and interpolation like any other characters.</p>

<pre><code [innerHTML]="string_formatting"></code></pre>

<li>Internationalization (i18n) and Localization (l10n)</li>
<p>The <code>gettext</code> module in Python is used for internationalization and localization, allowing you to
    create applications that support multiple languages and locales.</p>

<pre><code>
import gettext

lang = "fr_FR"  # French (France) locale
locale = gettext.translation("messages", localedir="locales", languages=[lang])
locale.install()

print(_("Hello, world!"))  # Translate this string in the 'locales' directory
    </code></pre>

<li>Unicode Escape Sequences</li>
<p>Unicode escape sequences allow you to represent Unicode characters using their hexadecimal code points.</p>

<pre><code>
escaped = "Hello, \u4F60\u597D"  # Represents "你好" in Unicode
    </code></pre>

<li>Normalization</li>
<p>Unicode normalization ensures that equivalent characters are represented in a consistent way. Python's
    <code>unicodedata</code> module provides functions for normalization.
</p>

<pre><code>
import unicodedata

normalized = unicodedata.normalize("NFC", text)
    </code></pre>

<p>Python's robust Unicode support makes it well-suited for working with text data from different languages and
    character sets. Remember to be mindful of encoding and decoding when dealing with text files and external
    data sources, and consider using Unicode normalization for consistency.</p>
