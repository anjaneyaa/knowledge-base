<h4>Dynamic Typing and Type Annotations in Python</h4>
<p>Dynamic typing and type annotations are important concepts in Python that relate to how data types are
    handled in the language and how you can provide hints about the expected types of variables and function
    parameters.</p>

<li>Dynamic Typing</li>
<p>Python is a dynamically typed language, which means that you don't need to declare the data type of a
    variable explicitly. The data type of a variable is determined at runtime based on the value it holds. This
    allows for more flexibility but requires careful attention to avoid type-related errors.</p>

<pre><code>
x = 5          # x is an integer
x = "Hello"    # x is now a string
    </code></pre>

<li>Type Annotations</li>
<p>While Python is dynamically typed, you can provide type hints using type annotations to indicate the expected
    data types of variables, function parameters, and return values. Type annotations are primarily used to
    improve code readability and for tools like static type checkers and IDEs.</p>

<pre><code>
def add(a: int, b: int) -&gt; int:
    return a + b
    </code></pre>

<li>Static Type Checkers</li>
<p>Tools like <code>mypy</code> can analyze your code and provide static type checking based on the type
    annotations you've added. This helps catch type-related errors before runtime.</p>

<pre><code>
# Assuming this is saved in a file named 'example.py'
def add(a: int, b: int) -&gt; int:
    return a + b

# Running mypy
# mypy example.py
    </code></pre>

<li>Type Annotations for Variables</li>
<p>You can also annotate variables with type hints to provide additional context about their expected types:</p>

<pre><code>
x: int = 5
name: str = "Alice"
    </code></pre>

<li>Optional and Union Types</li>
<p>You can indicate that a parameter can accept multiple types using the <code>Union</code> type from the
    <code>typing</code> module. You can also indicate that a parameter can be of a certain type or
    <code>None</code> using the <code>Optional</code> type.
</p>

<p>Type annotations provide valuable information about the expected types of variables and function parameters,
    improving code quality and documentation. They also help you catch type-related errors early during
    development. However, remember that Python's dynamic nature means that type annotations are not enforced at
    runtime; they primarily serve as documentation and can be used by static type checkers to identify potential
    issues.</p>
