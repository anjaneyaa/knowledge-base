    <ol>
        <li id="decorators">Decorators</li>
        <p>Decorators in Python are a powerful and flexible way to modify or enhance the behavior of functions or
            methods without changing their core logic. They are implemented using functions that take another
            function
            as an argument and return a new function with added functionality.</p>

        <li id="generators">Generators</li>
        <p>Generators are a type of iterable that allow you to iterate over a sequence of values without storing
            them
            all in memory at once. They are created using functions with the <code>yield</code> keyword, allowing
            you to
            generate values on-the-fly.</p>

        <li id="iterators">Iterators and Iterables</li>
        <p>Iterators are objects that implement the <code>__iter__()</code> and <code>__next__()</code> methods,
            allowing you to loop over a sequence of values. Iterables are objects that can be iterated over, and
            they
            provide an iterator when calling the <code>iter()</code> function.</p>

        <li id="context-managers">Context Managers</li>
        <p>Context managers in Python are used to manage resources, such as files or network connections, in a clean
            and
            efficient way. They are typically implemented using the <code>with</code> statement and the
            <code>__enter__()</code> and <code>__exit__()</code> methods.
        </p>

        <li id="metaclasses">Metaclasses</li>
        <p>Metaclasses are classes that define the behavior of other classes, often referred to as the "class of a
            class." They allow you to customize class creation and behavior, and they are used to implement features
            like class inheritance, attribute access, and more.</p>

        <li id="concurrency">Concurrency and Multithreading</li>
        <p>Concurrency involves executing multiple tasks concurrently to improve efficiency and responsiveness.
            Python's
            Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) can limit true parallelism, particularly in CPU-bound tasks. Techniques
            like
            threading and multiprocessing are used for concurrent programming.</p>

        <li id="coroutines">Coroutines and Asynchronous Programming</li>
        <p>Coroutines are functions that can be paused and resumed, allowing cooperative multitasking. Asynchronous
            programming with the <code>async</code> and <code>await</code> keywords enables efficient I/O-bound
            operations by allowing tasks to yield control while waiting for results.</p>

        <li id="memory-management">Memory Management</li>
        <p>Python's memory management involves techniques like reference counting and garbage collection to
            efficiently
            manage memory allocation and deallocation. Understanding memory management is important for writing
            efficient and memory-safe code.</p>

        <li id="performance">Performance Optimization</li>
        <p>Optimizing Python code involves techniques like profiling, benchmarking, and optimizing algorithms.
            Libraries
            like <code>timeit</code> and <code>cProfile</code> help identify performance bottlenecks and improve
            code
            efficiency.</p>

        <li id="dynamic-typing">Dynamic Typing and Type Annotations</li>
        <p>Python's dynamic typing allows variables to hold values of different types. Type annotations introduced
            in
            Python 3.5 provide hints about variable types, aiding in code readability and enabling static type
            checking
            using tools like <code>mypy</code>.</p>

        <li id="unicode">Unicode and Internationalization</li>
        <p>Python's support for Unicode enables working with text and characters from various languages and writing
            internationalized applications. Libraries like <code>unicodedata</code> and <code>gettext</code> assist
            in
            Unicode handling and localization.</p>

        <li id="c-extensions">C Extensions and Cython</li>
        <p>Python allows extending its capabilities using C extensions, enabling integration with existing C/C++
            code.
            Cython is a tool that simplifies creating C extensions by providing a Python-like syntax that gets
            compiled
            to C code.</p>
