<h4>Memory Management in Python</h4>
<p>Memory management in Python is an essential aspect of programming that involves the allocation and
    deallocation of memory for objects. Python handles memory management automatically through a combination of
    techniques, including reference counting, garbage collection, and memory pooling.</p>

<li>Reference Counting</li>
<p>Python uses reference counting to keep track of how many references there are to an object. When the
    reference count drops to zero, the memory occupied by the object is automatically freed.</p>

<li>Garbage Collection</li>
<p>While reference counting handles most memory deallocation, cyclic references (objects referencing each other)
    can lead to memory leaks. Python's garbage collector identifies and collects cyclic references, releasing
    memory for objects that are no longer reachable.</p>

<li>Memory Pooling</li>
<p>Python uses memory pooling to improve performance when allocating and deallocating memory for small objects.
    Small objects are grouped into memory blocks, and the memory manager allocates memory from these blocks
    rather than repeatedly calling lower-level system memory allocation functions.</p>

<li><code>gc</code> Module</li>
<p>Python's garbage collector can be controlled using the <code>gc</code> module. While it's not often necessary
    to manually trigger garbage collection, you can use the <code>gc.collect()</code> function to encourage the
    garbage collector to run.</p>

<li>Memory Optimization</li>
<ul>
    <li>Avoid circular references to prevent memory leaks.</li>
    <li>Use generators and iterators for memory-efficient processing of large datasets.</li>
    <li>Use context managers (<code>with</code> statements) for automatic resource cleanup.</li>
    <li>Consider memory profiling tools to identify memory usage bottlenecks.</li>
</ul>

<li>Memory Profiling Tools</li>
<p>Tools like <code>memory_profiler</code>, <code>objgraph</code>, and <code>guppy</code> can help you profile
    and analyze memory usage in your Python code, allowing you to identify memory-hungry parts of your program.
</p>

<li>Memory Views and Buffer Protocols</li>
<p>Python provides memory views and buffer protocols, which allow efficient sharing of memory between different
    data structures without copying data.</p>

<li>C Extensions and Memory Management</li>
<p>When working with C extensions in Python, be aware of memory management. Use appropriate memory allocation
    and deallocation functions provided by the Python C API to avoid memory leaks.</p>

<p>Python's automatic memory management and garbage collection significantly simplify the programming process,
    relieving developers of many manual memory management tasks. However, it's still important to be aware of
    memory usage patterns and potential pitfalls, especially in memory-intensive applications.</p>
