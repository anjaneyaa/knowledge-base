<h4>Decorators in Python</h4>
<p>Decorators in Python are a powerful and flexible way to modify or enhance the behavior of functions or
    methods without changing their core logic. Decorators are often used for tasks such as logging,
    authentication, caching, and more. They are implemented using functions that take another function as an
    argument and return a new function with added functionality.</p>

<li>Example of Decorators</li>
<pre><code>
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        func()
        print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
    return wrapper

@my_decorator
def say_hello():
    print("Hello, world!")

say_hello()
    </code></pre>

<p>In this example, the <code>my_decorator</code> function takes another function (<code>func</code>) as an
    argument, defines a new function <code>wrapper</code> that wraps around <code>func</code>, and then returns
    <code>wrapper</code>. The <code>@my_decorator</code> syntax above the <code>say_hello</code> function is a
    shorthand way of applying the decorator to the <code>say_hello</code> function.
</p>

<p>When you call <code>say_hello()</code>, the output will be:</p>

<pre>
Something is happening before the function is called.
Hello, world!
Something is happening after the function is called.
    </pre>

<li>Advanced Usage</li>
<pre><code [innerHTML]="greet_decorator"></code></pre>

<p>This will produce:</p>

<pre>
Hi, Something is happening before the function is called.
Something is happening before the function is called.
Hello, world!
Something is happening after the function is called.
Hi, Something is happening after the function is called.
    </pre>

<p>Decorators provide a clean and modular way to add functionality to functions or methods without modifying
    their original code. They are widely used in Python to enhance the behavior of various frameworks and
    libraries.</p>
